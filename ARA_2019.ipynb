    "# Analysis of Results of the 2019 ARA National Championships Presented by AMSOIL #\n",
    "*Darren McGlinchey*\n",
    "\n",
    "The [American Rally Association (ARA)](https://www.americanrallyassociation.org/) is the top stage rally competition in the United States. I've been following the success of the [Subaru Motorsports USA](https://www.subaru.com/motorsports) team via the popular YouTube show \"Launch Control\". The team has dominated the rally scene in the US for the last decade, particularly with the Driver/Co-Driver pair David Higgens & Craig Drew. I was curious if the dominance of Subaru in the top Open 4 wheel drive (O4WD) class trickled down. How popular are Subaru's throughout the classes in which they can compete? How successful are they in their classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to look into answering these questions beginning with the 2019 season. I chose the 2019 season for a few reasons. First, it is recent and wasn't effected by the Covid pandemic like the 2020 season. And secondly, it was the last season in which Higgens & Drew drove for Subaru Motorsports USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting & Cleaning the Data ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the above questions I'm looking for the following data:\n",
    "* National results for each race in the 2019 season (I'll ignore regional results for now)\n",
    "* Primarily interested in overall results rather than individual stage times\n",
    "* Should contain overall position, driver/co-driver, car, class, total time, and position in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was unable to find a compiled and available dataset containing results of the 2019 season. Some, but not all, of the 2019 results can be found on the [ARA](https://www.americanrallyassociation.org/) website, however not in an easily scrapable format. While compiling the results by hand would not be a huge undertaking given the number of races (9) and modest number of competitors per race (14-49), thankfully there was another way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The website [ewrc-results.com](https://www.ewrc-results.com/) is a website by rally fans attempting to compile a public database of world rally events and results. They appear to have complete listings and results for each race in the season in a more scraping-friendly format. I'll start there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by getting the results for each event individually. There were 9 events in the [2019 ARA season](https://www.ewrc-results.com/season/2019/994-ara/):\n",
